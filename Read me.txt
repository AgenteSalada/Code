The next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 16S rRNA gene amplicon generates large amounts of raw sequence data that needs to be processed
before being annotated against a reference database. Processing reads into comprehensive biological information consists in decreasing the 
complexity from these huge sequence datasets until annotation tables using high-performance algorithms integrated in bioinformatics pipelines 

This work aimed to analyze the metagenome of six samples collected in three different dams using the DADA2 pipeline

DADA2 uses a method similar to other software such as QIIME and mothur, but replaces OTU tables with ASV tables that have higher resolution,
and also introduces an algorithm that uses errors introduced during the PCR to infer the sample composition.
